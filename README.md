Fed up of supermakets working behind the scenes hand-in-hand with the multinationals to confuse the mathematically illiterate ?

Well, you should be, because they're probably targeting YOU !

Diversification of brands is all well and good, untul they do it to trip you up and extort money from you, just look at this:


Twiglets (Uniliver)

| Weight | Grammage |
| -------|------|
| "z"    | "d"
| "c"    | "th"
| "j"    | "dzh"
| "ch"   | "th"
date: ???

Who the blood hell knows how to work that out* ?

Exactly. So, what you can do is type the price and weight in (grammage here in the UK) and then see how much it costs between the products.

The calculation rounds up to the closest penny, as nobody's going to care about 0.002p and probably just give up.
